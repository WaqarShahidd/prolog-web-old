                    It was indeed a well-organized event with select partners
                    from all over the world. The boat trip and the historic Sait
                    Halim Pa≈üa Manison were particularly and truly remarkable.
                    The meetings and the social events contributed to the closer
                    relations and cooperation in between the members and your
                    great network management team. It was a pleasure to be with
                    you, your family, and the members in Istanbul, thank you for
                    your great work for us all.
